						  <p><h2>ANS Membership</h2></p>
						  Membership of the African Nutrition Society is open to any person who has an academic background in nutrition or related subjects including those allied to medicine with a genuine interest in the science of nutrition and its application to clinical and dietetic states, developmental biology and chronic disease, animal nutrition and health, the food industry, food security, nutrition and health policy. Applicants must be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in nutritional science and uphold the aims of ANS to protect, promote, advance and influence the scientific study and professional practice of nutrition in Africa. Membership is pan-African as well as international (worldwide) and <b><u>not</u></b> restricted by language, race, colour, creed or nationality. All registered members of ANS will have equal voting rights and access to the benefits of membership. The African Nutrition Society is a purely non-partisan, non-political scientific learned society of individual members who share a common interest and the vision and mission of the organization. The ANS will therefore not allow its platform to be used for the advancement of any political or personal interests. All members must abide by the strict code of ethics defined in the articles of association (constitution) and under the ¿nutrition Profession¿ in this document. Membership runs from January to December and to enjoy the full benefits, all members will be expected to renew their membership annually.
						  <p><h2>Membership details</p></h2> 
						  Once registered, members are expected to inform the ANS of any changes in their details (including change of address, contact details, demographics, interests, job and workplace). Each member will have a membership number (and pass word) which will enable them access information on the membership pages at the ANS website www.answeb.org.
